/**
 * PrivateTransferVault - Sepolia Testnet Deployment Script
 * =======================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE: 
 * Deploy the PrivateTransferVault contract to Sepolia testnet with automatic verification.
 * This script handles the complete deployment process, including:
 * 1. Contract deployment
 * 2. Etherscan verification
 * 3. Saving the contract address for future script use
 * 
 * PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
 * - This minimal contract stores NO user data
 * - It only accepts commitment hashes and emits events
 * - This design ensures maximum privacy for transactions
 * - Full source code verification on Etherscan lets users audit the privacy guarantees
