 * PrivateTransferVault - Advanced Privacy Features Demo on Sepolia
 * ==============================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This file demonstrates advanced privacy features for the Private Transfer Vault
 * including TEE remote attestation and view key mechanisms. It executes a real
 * transaction on Sepolia testnet that combines these privacy-enhancing technologies.
 * 
 * ADVANCED PRIVACY FEATURES:
 * 1. TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Simulation
 *    - Remote attestation of secure enclaves
 *    - Enclave identity verification
 *    - Secure data processing simulation
 * 
 * 2. View Key Mechanism
 *    - Selective disclosure of transaction data
 *    - Encrypted storage of transaction details
 *    - Controlled access to decrypted information
 *    - Key expiration for time-limited access
 * 
 * PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Transaction details remain encrypted and off-chain
 * - Only commitment hashes are stored on the Sepolia blockchain
 * - View keys provide controlled access to transaction details
 * - Simulated TEE ensures secure data handling
 * - All cryptographic operations happen locally, not on-chain

 * 
 * PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE:
 * 1. Transaction details are encrypted with view keys
 * 2. Only commitment hashes are stored on the blockchain
 * 3. Authorized parties with valid view keys can decrypt transaction details
 * 4. View keys have expiration times for temporal access control
 * 5. In production, view keys would be managed within a TEE

 * - Time-limited validity (24-hour expiration)
