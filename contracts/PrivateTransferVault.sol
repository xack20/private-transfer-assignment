/**
 * @title PrivateTransferVault
 * @dev A commitment-based private transfer vault that emits events with only a commitment hash.
 * This preserves privacy by not exposing sender, recipient, or amount information on-chain.
 *
 * PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE:
 * 1. All sensitive transfer details (sender, recipient, amount) remain off-chain
 * 2. Only cryptographic commitments are stored on the blockchain
 * 3. The commitment is a keccak256 hash of (sender, recipient, amount, timestamp)
 * 4. No transfer details can be extracted from the commitment due to the one-way nature of hashing
 * 5. This approach ensures complete privacy while maintaining auditability with proper view keys
 *
 * VISIBILITY CONTROL:
 * - Transaction data is never exposed on-chain
 * - Etherscan shows only "PrivateTransfer" events with commitment hashes
 * - View keys (implemented off-chain) provide selective visibility to authorized parties

     * TECHNICAL DETAILS:
     * - The commitment should be generated off-chain using: keccak256(abi.encode(sender, recipient, amount, timestamp))
     * - Only the hash is submitted, making it mathematically impossible to extract the original values
     * - This function is intentionally minimal to prevent any data leakage
     * - No storage variables are used, further enhancing privacy by leaving no on-chain traces
     * - The commitment serves as a cryptographic proof that a specific transfer occurred without revealing details
     * 
     * PRIVACY GUARANTEES:
     * - No sender information is stored or emitted
     * - No recipient information is stored or emitted
     * - No amount information is stored or emitted
     * - No long-term storage is used, only events (reduces attack surface)
